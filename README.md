SENS-Simmons
Independent Study Spring 2017

This program is designed to help extract the referenced
information out of an academic journal.

1) To use this program you must save the journal as a .txt file.
Since I had PDF files I used pdftotext.com to convert the files I wanted to
use into text files.
2) After you have your text file saved in the SAME folder as the python code,
go ahead and enter the name of the file you want the program to parse. When
entering the name of the file it is important to make sure that what you type in
matches EXACTLY.
For example, say I have a file named maxFile1.txt. When prompted to enter the
name of the file I would type maxFile1. Note that I did not include the
.txt at the end of the file.
3) After the program runs, you will have an XML file and a CSV file of the
references. These files will have the same name as the text file.

*Please note that this program is not perfect and may not extract all of the
referenced material in the journal article.
